2. Solving application problems using stacks, including expression conversion.
3. Mastering linked list operations and their applications in stack and queue implementations.
4. Representation and manipulation of trees, including binary trees and binary search trees.
5. Application of sorting and searching algorithms, including bubble, insertion, selection, quick, merge sort, and heap sort.
6. Analysis and processing of graphs using various representations, including adjacency lists and matrices.
7. Implementation of hash tables and observation of collision resolution schemes.
8. Simulation of memory allocation strategies such as first-fit, best-fit, and worst-fit, along with basic memory allocation and garbage collection using doubly linked lists.
